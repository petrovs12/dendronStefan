# Children Screen Time


## Children Screen Time from 
[Mayo Clinic Article](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/screen-time/art-20047952)

Unstructured playtime is more valuable for a young child's developing brain than is electronic media. Children younger than age 2 are more likely to learn and remember information from a live presentation than they are from a video.

By age 2, children can benefit from some types of screen time, such as programming with music, movement and stories. By watching together, you can help your child understand what he or she is seeing and apply it in real life. However, passive screen time shouldn't replace reading, playing or problem-solving.

As your child grows, keep in mind that too much or poor quality screen time has been linked to:

* Obesity
* Irregular sleep schedules and shorter duration of sleep
* Behavioral problems
* Loss of social skills
* Violence
* Less time for play
